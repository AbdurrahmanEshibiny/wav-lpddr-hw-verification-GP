Requirements:
1- Windows 10/11
2- questa sim simulator (tested with version 2021.1)

To collect coverage steps:
1- >> add all the required tests' names into "testcases.txt"
2- >> collect_coverage.bat
	or
   >> collect_coverage.bat -short
- PLEASE note: using "-short" will collect coverage of the DUT and wddr_pkg only, which makes the size of the coverage report smaller, however, anything outside these two will not be covered.

- the project will be compiled with the required options for coverage
- each testcase listed in "testcases.txt" will be executed
- "coverage_output" directory will be created containing a report (.ucdb file) 
  per test
- all the reports (the .ucdb files) will be merged into the final report "final.ucdb"
- the final report will be converted into html files for easy access and browsing
- NOTICE!!:
	to view a (.ucdb) file you can use the following command:
	vsim -viewcov REPORT_NAME.ucdb

notice, you can view a specific

Steps:
In a windows terminal (or powershell) write the following commands:
1- >> cd <repo path>/verif
2- >> compile.bat
3- >>
